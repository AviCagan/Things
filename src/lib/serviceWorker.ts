/*
  The service worker exists for exactly one reason: Web Push on Jackie's iOS
  home-screen install. Push handlers *are* the service worker there, which is
  why the build uses injectManifest rather than generateSW.

  Inside the Android APK it is not just unnecessary, it is actively harmful,
  and it is what made three consecutive "here's the new APK" round-trips look
  like stale downloads:

    Capacitor serves the app from https://localhost/, so the service worker
    precaches index.html and the hashed JS bundle into Cache Storage. That
    cache lives in the WebView's data directory, which SURVIVES an APK
    update — only an uninstall or "clear storage" removes it. So a new APK
    installs correctly, with completely new files on disk, and then the old
    service worker intercepts the request for "/" and serves the previous
    index.html straight back out of cache, which references the previous
    bundle's filenames, which are also cached. New APK, old app, no error.

    registerType: 'autoUpdate' is supposed to cover this, but it depends on
    the WebView noticing a byte-changed sw.js and then activating and
    reloading — which is unreliable there and, at best, lands one launch
    late. That's indistinguishable from "the build didn't take".

  Android gets its push through FCM and loads its assets from the APK, so it
  needs none of this. Registration is now explicit and web-only, and on native
  we tear down anything a previous build left behind — which is what lets a
  phone already stuck in this state fix itself on next launch instead of
  needing an uninstall.
