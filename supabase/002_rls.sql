-- Things — row level security
--
-- The posture, stated plainly:
--
-- The anon key is NOT a secret. It ships inside the JS bundle, which GitHub
-- Pages serves publicly, so anyone who opens DevTools has it. The only real
-- question is what that key is ALLOWED to do.
--
-- Answer: nothing. Every policy below grants `authenticated` only, and `anon`
-- gets no policy at all. The two phones sign in once each to a single shared
-- household account (unlocked by the PIN), and supabase-js persists and
-- refreshes that session indefinitely — so day to day it is still just
-- "tap your name", and the database is not world-writable.
--
-- IMPORTANT companion step, in the Supabase dashboard:
--   Authentication → Providers → Email → turn OFF "Enable email signups".
-- Otherwise the public anon key can create brand new accounts, and those
-- accounts would then satisfy `to authenticated` and walk straight past the
-- PIN. That toggle is what makes this posture actually hold.
